                media apps.Because of this , cases of accounts or passwords getting hacked has become very common.In
                this
                article,we will discuss security precautions to take to manage the passwords.</p><br>

                <div class="weak-password">
                    <p><b>Don’t choose a weak password</b>- Choosing a weak password is one of the common reasons behind
                        this issue of
                        hacking.Weaker the password,higher the chances of getting your account or password
                        hacked.Birthday
                        dates,(name)@123 and 12344321 are some common examples of weak passwords.</p>

                <div class="different-passwords">
                    <p><b>Different passwords for all the apps</b>- One should never go for the same password for all
                        the
                        apps.Always choose
                        different passwords for different apps and websites.A password should be specific to that
                        particular
                        app so that
                        we can remember it and differentiate from the rest of the passwords.</p>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <p><span style="color: olive;">soc1al$t0r|e&</span> would be a perfect password for social media
                        apps like facebook,instagram and
                        snapchat.</p>
                    <p><span style="color: olive;">$Nap{&h0t}</span> would be a perfect password for the gallery app.

                        task.This task can
                        be easily solved by making notes of all the passwords or writing it down in the form of a list
                        on
                        any paper.</p><br>

                        managing the
                        passwords. But still there are great chances of getting hacked .This can be prevented by
                        frequently
                        changing the
                        passwords.'Changing the passwords' here doesn’t mean completely replacing the previous password
                        with
                        the brand
                        new one.Doing some minor changes in symbols or letters in the password can make a big
                        difference.
